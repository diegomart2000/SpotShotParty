# SpotShotParty

Look no further. This is your perfect excuse to take all those tequila shots with your friends. You will be able to say something like this:

- I've not been drinking, honey. I've just played SpotShotParty with the guys 🙃

### Here is the deal.

SpotShotParty is a guess the song game to play with friends. It's based on Spotify APIs 👌

Guess the song or take a tequila shot! 😗


Believe me, it is a lot of fun 🍻

### Wanna play with the kiddos? Say no more. 
Instead of taking a tequila shot, you will have the opportunity to shot you water gun in their faces.

That's way more fun and you already have your excuse.

- Hey wife, those are the rules 😌
